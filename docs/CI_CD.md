# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of two main workflows:
1. Continuous Integration (ci.yml)
2. Continuous Deployment (cd.yml)

## CI Pipeline

### Triggers
- Push to main or automation-fixes branches
- Pull requests to main

### Jobs

1. Test
   - Runs the full test suite
   - Validates GCP configuration
   - Tests all automation scripts

2. Lint
   - Runs shellcheck on all shell scripts
   - Enforces consistent coding style

3. Security Scan
   - Runs ShellCheck in security mode
   - Scans for secrets with Trufflehog

## CD Pipeline

### Triggers
- Push to main branch
- Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

### Jobs

1. Deploy
   - Validates GCP authentication
   - Runs deployment script
   - Validates deployment
   - Sets up monitoring
   - Notifies deployment status

## Required Secrets

1. `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
   - Google Cloud project identifier

2. `GCP_SA_KEY`
   - Service account key JSON

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment
Configured with:
- Required reviewers
- Environment protection rules
- Deployment approvals

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Deployment Status
- Comments on PRs
- Updates deployment status
- Sends notifications on failure

### Script Integration
The notification system uses notify.js to:
- Create deployment records
- Update PR status
- Send notifications

## Adding New Workflows

1. Create new workflow file in .github/workflows/
2. Follow existing patterns for:
   - Environment setup
   - Secret handling
   - Error reporting

## Security Considerations

1. Secrets Management
   - Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets
   - Use environment protection rules

2. Access Control
   - Limit production deployments
   - Require approval for sensitive environments

3. Code Scanning
   - ShellCheck security mode
   - Trufflehog secret scanning
